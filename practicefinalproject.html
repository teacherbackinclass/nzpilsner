<header><strong>Wrong Address Pilsner</strong></header>
<p>Hello! This is a recipe that I modified from Gordon Strong's in <a href="https://byo.com/recipe/new-zealand-pilsner/">BYO Magazine</a></p>
<p>New Zealand Pilsner is a pale lager that combines some of the great attributes of Pilsner and Kölsch with the modern twist of New Zealand hops. This beer is pale, dry, golden in color, and clean fermented. It really allows for the characteristically tropical, citrisy, fruity, grassy New Zealand hops to shine.</p>

<h3 id="Yeast">Yeast</h3>
<p> There is a wide selection of yeast to choose from for this style. They include the following:  </p>
<p> *For all of these I would either use two packets or make a <a href="https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/how-to-brew/make-yeast-starter/">yeast starter</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Dry Yeast:</b> Fermentis Saflager 34/70</li>
<li><b>Wyeast:</b> Bohemian Lager #2124</li>
<li><b>White Labs:</b> German Lager Yeast #WLP830</li>
<li><b>Omega Yeast:</b>Lutra Kveik #OYL071 *This is techincally is an ale stran so you will be makind a pseudo-lager but if works if you need your beer done in under a week*</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="BrewDaySteps">Brew Day Steps</h3>
<p>On brew day, prepare your ingredients; mill the grains, measure your hops, and prepare your water. This recipe uses reverse osmosis (RO) water. Add ¼ tsp 10% phosphoric acid per 5 gallons (19 L) of brewing water, or until water measures pH 5.5 at room temperature. Add 1 tsp. calcium chloride (CaCl2) to the mash.</p>
<p>On brew day, mash in all the grains at 149 °F (65 °C) in 16 qts. (15 L) of water, and hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Raise the temperature by infusion or direct heating to 168 °F (76 °C) to mashout. Recirculate for 15 minutes. Fly sparge with 168 °F (76 °C) water until 6.5 gallons (25 L) of wort is collected.</p>
<p>Boil the wort for 75 minutes, adding the hops at times indicated in the ingredients list. The first wort hops are added to the kettle just before sparging begins. Chill to 48 °F (9 °C) and rack to the fermenter.</p>

<h3 id="Fermentation">Fermentation</h3>
<p> I am a fan of <a href="https://brulosophy.com/methods/lager-method/">Brulosophy</a> Lager method. I will give an abbreviated version of those steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li> <b><i>Primary Fermentation</i></b>
Chill wort to pitching temp of 48°-53°F (9°-12°C), pitch adequately sized starter (decanted), set regulator to initial fermentation temp between 50°-55°F (10°-13°C), and leave the beer to ferment until it is at least 50% attenuated. For this beer it will take approximately 5-8 days</li>
<li><b><i>The Ramp Up</i></b>
Once 50% attenuation is reached, remove the probe from the side of the fermentor so it measures ambient temp in the chamber and start bumping the regulator up 5°F every 12 hours until it reaches 65°-68°F (18°-20°C). Allow the beer to remain at this temp until fermentation is complete and the yeast have cleaned-up after themselves, which can take anywhere from 4 to 10 days.</li>
<li><b><i>The Ramp Down</i></b>
When FG is stable and no diacetyl or acetaldehyde is detected in the beer, begin ramping the temp down in 5°-8°F increments every 12 hours or so until it reaches 30°-32°F (-1°-0°C). Allow the beer to remain at this temp for 3-5 days, during which it will begin to drop clear.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Packaging">Packaging</h3>
<p>Once the beer is clear, it’s ready to be packaged, the process of which is obviously different depending on whether one uses kegs or bottles. Yes, bottle conditioning is absolutely possible with this method.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>For Those Who Keg…</i>Simply transfer the cold and clear beer to your keg, place it in your keezer on gas, and leave it for 3+ days before enjoying! Using my typical kegging/carbonation method in conjunction with gelatin, I’ve found the beer is usually ready for consumption after about 5 days of “lagering” in my keezer, while others swear their beers peak after 2 weeks or so of cold storage. This is likely an issue of subjective preference mixed with a sprinkle of confirmation bias, but regardless, do what you works best for you!</li>
    <li><i>For Those Who Bottle…</i>Use a trusted <a href="https://www.morebeer.com/content/priming_sugar_calculator">priming sugar calculator</a>to determine the amount of your preferred fermentable to use; adding extra yeast is unnecessary, even if you fined with gelatin. Place the primed bottles in an environment that maintains a fairly consistent 68°-72°F (20°-23°C) and allow them to carbonate for 2-3 weeks. Once carbonated, I recommend placing multiple bottles in the fridge to “bottle lager” for 5+ days before enjoying, as this will encourage the precipitation of most particulate matter, providing you a clear and delicious lager beer.</li>
</ul>
